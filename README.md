# frf

a very loosely forth-inspired interpreted language.

written in purebasic, for reasons.

i didn't really 'do' version control last time I worked on this project so there are two archival branches, which will remain as-is for historical purposes:
*  frf-prototype-1
*  frf-partial-rework

the partial rework was undirected and very much a victim of second system syndrome, and never actually worked.

since frf-prototype-1 was functioning (if kinda simplistic), i intend to try to build off of that and make incremental changes hereafter (although if possible I will draw from the rework where reasonable)
