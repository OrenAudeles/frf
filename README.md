# frf

a very loosely forth-inspired interpreted language.

written in purebasic, for reasons.

i didn't really 'do' version control last time I worked on this project so there are two archival branches, which will remain as-is for historical purposes:
*  frf-prototype-1
*  frf-partial-rework

the partial rework was undirected and very much a victim of second system syndrome, and never actually worked.

since frf-prototype-1 was functioning (if kinda simplistic), i intend to try to build off of that and make incremental changes hereafter (although if possible I will draw from the rework where reasonable)

wip builds are in the `build/` folder. i'm currently building windows and linux. mac will come once i get a mac running again.

i have no idea on if the linux builds will work on arbitrary linux systems. gtk2 is likely to be required, beyond that? it is a mystery

eventually i'll start posting releases properly, but as i see it not much point in that until i have a proper environment

## documentation

documentation is clearly some kind of attempt at graphing the design as of 2012, i have no idea on how accurate it is at this point

somewhere i should have a txt file that is a dump of the "man" pages for muf, the primary reference material i am using for this stuff. because let's be honest, frf is an attempt at creating a general purpose version of muf not attached to a text-based game server.

## temp
temp contains mysterious things. i cannot remember their purpose. (except the propertygrid bits, those are probably source examples that I used for `propgrid.pb`)
